### About Me


![My face](/assets/images/face.png){:class="centered-image"}


I'm Dominic! I'm a Canadian currently living in Brooklyn, NY. I help build [Google Keep](keep.google.com).

As a child, I was digging through my parents' bookshelf before a roadtrip and found a book about BASIC from a course they had taken. My parents advised against it &mdash; "you'll get bored" &mdash; but I was intrigued and brought it along. The first application it walked you through was a mortgage calculator. I had no idea what a mortgage was, but the concept of being able to tell a computer what to do hooked me. As we were in a car, I couldn't actually try out the code, but my mind instantly began putting together programs. The minute I got home, I typed in the mortgage calculator line by line and excitedly called my parents over to proudly display just how much interest I would owe, much to their confusion.

Throughout high school and university, web development as well as game development were my main interests. I spent years fiddling with an open-source MMORPG engine and building web sites about agmes I liked. Thankfully no screenshots exist, as my design skills were non-existant. I loved the accessibility of the Internet - my applications could work on any computer without needing any installation.

Eventually, this led me to the world of freelance, and then to working for a software consultancy in Montreal that used their own dialect of [Scheme](http://www.jazzscheme.org/). In the mean time, I continued following my interest in game development, particularly [roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) as they appealed to my aforementioned lack of design skills. My old blog, [Coding Cookies](http://codingcookies.com/), was primarily centered around building a Roguelike in Javascript.

When I'm not trying to get computers to work, I enjoy cooking (particularly fermenting projects), pottery (trying to make a plate set for a tasting menu), riding my bike around New York, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21652187-dominic).
