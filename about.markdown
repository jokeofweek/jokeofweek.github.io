I'm Dominic! I'm a Canadian currently living in Brooklyn, NY. 

I currently help build the SDKs at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). In the past, I've:

* worked on a variety of Google products (Keep, Docs, Slides, and Google+) primarily focusing on the web applications (Javascript and Java).
* worked at a software consultancy where I primarily built web apps using a [home-grown Scheme dialect](https://github.com/jazzscheme/jazz) and PHP.
* worked on an MMORPG written in Visual Basic 6.

I really enjoy [roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) and wrote [a number of blog posts](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/11/25/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-16/) focused on building a Roguelike in Javascript.

When I'm not trying to get computers to work, I enjoy cooking (particularly fermenting projects), pottery, riding my bike around New York, and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21652187-dominic).
